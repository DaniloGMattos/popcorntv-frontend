A movie data showcase applicationt built with [MovieDB API](https://themoviedb.org) and ReactJS.

This project was built as a developer portolio project, with the initial objective to  solve the following challenge :  

> Build a web site that returns TMDb data, for that, build your own API to consume that data using MySQL in 3 days. 

## How to run this project:

**Before you do anything in this project, be sure to execute the [back-end project first](https://github.com/DaniloGMattos/popcorntv-backend), after that you can follow this steps:**

In the project directory, you can run:

Runs the app in the development mode.\

## Features implemented today 
- Top movies screen
- Movie details screen

## Futher development and point to improve

For this  project, after the 3 days of the challenge I intend to archive 100% of the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/6RhE6cOOnR5rd9dCEKlhZP/Untitled?node-id=14%3A188), including improving the Figma Design itself. To archive this goal I need to : 

 - [] Show average move rating with a progress bar 
 - [] Create authentication system 
 - [] Use more data from the TMDb
 - [] Start working with animations
